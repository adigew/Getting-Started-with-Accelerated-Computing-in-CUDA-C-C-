CUDA is used to accelerate CPU-only applications by making them run on GPUs . These CUDA applications are massively parallel and way faster than their CPU-only counterparts. Experience C/C++ application acceleration by:

Parallelizing applications to run on GPUs
Optimizing applications by using CUDA techniques like memory management
Learning techniques like concurrency and CUDA streams
Learning tools like Nsight Systems to profile and identify bottlenecks
